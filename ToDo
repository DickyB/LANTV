ToDo:
fix episode number in onscreen schedule display (low priority fix)

*display schedules of other channels
	Can probably just function almost the entire thing of showschedule,
	with arg of channelname.  Then call that function using each of the 
	args to showschedule adding all output to a nice list, then write
	all that to dyntext2.txt as usual.  Using current channel as the
	first arg, etc.  Should look nice, but I can't be arsed to do this
	for the test build, since overlays will not be included as default,
	due to ffmpeg recompilation requirements.  Basic 1 channel
	functionality will be in, but overlay options to ffmpeg in cameraman
	and fillshow will not be default (probably should put example
	overlay-enabled stuff in comments in those scripts somewhere handy).
	*this is done on my setup, so ignore all that.

remove extra config reading from some of the scripts
