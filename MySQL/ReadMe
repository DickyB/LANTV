For this thing to even work, as-is, you'll need a MySQL database set up.
You'll also need to scan all your video files and have them in the database.


First, you'll need to login to MySQL (you need an account)

mysql -u mysql_user -p
Enter password:

then:

mysql > create database databasename;
mysql > show databases;
mysql > create user thisisusername;
mysql > grant all on databasename.* to 'thisisusername'@'localhost' identified by 'thisispassword';

(that grants EVERYTHING to thisisusername, so if you don't like that, look
up how to limit access)
This should create your database, and have it ready to use.  You'll want to
change databasename, thisisusername, and thisispassword to appropriate
strings.

next:

mysql > create table Video ( fullpath TEXT NOT NULL, filename TEXT NOT NULL, length TEXT NOT NULL)

That should hook you up with everything you need to start filling it up with
your video files' info.

The script I use is 4 years old, highly modified for my specific needs,
including making thumbnails.  It's horribly written, and not ready for
sharing.

Basically, you'll have to write it or wait until I get it fixed up and
stripped down for use with this.  It's fairly easy, though.

use find to get a full listing of all the video files. Then go through the
list and use ffmpeg to find the length of the video, then put the three
values fullpath, filename, and length into the table.  Note: fullpath is the
full path plus filename.  Kind of redundant, but that's the way I'm doing it
for something else.  This project is really just leeching off the other
thing's database.
