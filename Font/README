This is where the fonts go that you want to use, when you enable and use
text overlays.  Ffmpeg doesn't come stock with that support, you'll need to
recompile for that.  It's not that scary, but don't worry about it until you
get everything *else* working.

I know you could use the path to fonts you use for xorg, but on a headless
system, that path isn't there.  It's easier this way.
